  - bugs:
    - overlapping water sources interfere with each other's numbers
    - consume water in farms
    - don't spread influence through forests, mtns, etc
    - water still spreads too slowly
    - only allow building within influence (except first building)
    - deleting building doesn't remove topo's influence source

  - ideas:
    - floods
    - easter island
      - different scenarios (also the nile)
    - tablets which are sets of actions

  - refactor:
    - register entity makeFn's and consolidate gameReducer

  - level editor
    - separate mode that can be entered/exited

  - UI
    - tag for displaying indicator values tracking delta since last turn
