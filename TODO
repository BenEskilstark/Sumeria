  - bugs:
    - overlapping water sources interfere with each other's numbers
    - consume water in farms
    - don't spread influence through forests, mtns, etc
    - water still spreads too slowly

  - ideas:
    - floods
    - easter island
      - all multiples of 6 if we stay sumerian
      - different scenarios (also the nile)
    - digging produces 10 clay
      - and requires population
    - 5x pop per hut --> 20 food stored
    - farms produce 2 food
      - system for prioritizing how population is allocated
    - tablets which are sets of actions

  - level editor
    - separate mode that can be entered/exited

  - UI
    - json-card which can show info on hover
      - in UI/PlayerResources.js
    - tag for displaying indicator values tracking delta since last turn

  - resources
    - buildings have cost attached to their entity
    - selector which takes in a building and your resources and
      says whether you can afford it
      - mutator that takes in same params but actually spends them
    - clay
      - acquired after digging, spent when piling
        - also spent on huts
    - food
      - acquired when farms are irrigated in your influence at EoT
        - and require population to farm them
      - stored in granaries (and huts?)
        - add isFoodStore property
    - population
      - max is based off housing from huts
        - add isHouse property
      - needed to perform tasks -- how?
    - wood
      - need action for cutting down trees
